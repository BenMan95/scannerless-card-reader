# Scannerless Card Reader

A simple way to quickly input cards from Magic: The Gathering without a camera.

I made this because in my experience, I've found card scanners to be clunky and finicky to use. Additionaly, they can have difficulty differentiating between different printings of the same card, slowing them down even more. Inputting cards this way lets you quickly narrow down to the correct card.
